A bot for "Volition-Tec Station". Also my first open-source project, ever, and my first Git project, ever...

This bot has minimal functionality. It's MOSTLY up to the owner of the server what should be added or changed on the bot, but I will not be denying opportunities for other Gitters to make pull requests or commit issues for the bot. As a matter of fact, have at it. :3
